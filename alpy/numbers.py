"""# Numbers

Computers are very good at numbers. Here is how you
perform the basic math operations, like addition

```python
a = 2
b = 1
c = a + b
```

| Equation    | Python code    | Example       | Description     |
| ------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| a + b       | a + b          | 12  + 2 = 14  | Addition        |
| a - b       | a - b          | 12  - 2 = 10  | Subtraction     |
| a x b       | a * b          | 12  * 2 = 24  | Multiplication  |
| a ÷ b       | a / b          | 12  / 2 = 6.0 | Division        |
| a ^ b       | a ** b         | 12 ** 2 = 144 | Exponentiation  |
| a mod b     | a % b          | 12  % 5 = 2   | Modulo/Remainder|
| a ÷ b       | a // b         | 12 // 5 = 2   | Floor Division  |


Just as in regular mathematics, python statements follow
